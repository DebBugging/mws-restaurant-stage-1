# Restaurant Reviews App Project
---

## Project Overview

For this project, I converted a static restaurant reviews webpage to a mobile-ready web application. This was a static design that lacked accessibility and responsiveness. I used Flexbox to make it viewable across all viewports and added more features such as ARIA labels for Accessibility. I also included Service Worker to cache content for offline use.

### Specification

The stater code was provided by Udacity. The code had a lot of issues. It was barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also didn't include any standard accessibility features and it didn't work offline at all.

The Udacity [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1090/view) has a list of all the minimium requirements to complete the project.

### Instructions

1. Clone or download the Repository.

2. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (All Windows users do this). For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software. Python is free to use.

3. With your server running, go to the site: `http://localhost:8000`.

### Contributing
 
I received a lot of pointers from [Project 1 MWS Webinar with Doug Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92dtrNU1GQc).

I also received help on several occasions from my fantastic peers who are taking
this Udacity Nano-Degree alongside me.

#### Enjoy!
